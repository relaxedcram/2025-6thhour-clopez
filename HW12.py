#1. Create a while loop with variable i that counts down from 5 to 0 and then prints
#"Hello World!" at the end.
i = 5
while i >= 0:
    print(i)
    i-=1
else:

#2. Create a while loop that prints only even numbers between 1 and 30 (HINT: modulo).
j = 1
while j <= 30:
    if j % 2 == 0:
        print(j)

#3. Create a while loop that prints from 1 to 30 and continues (skips the number) if the
#number is divisible by 3.
k = 1

        k +=1
        continue

#4. Create a while loop that randomly generates a number between 1 and 6, prints the result,
#and then breaks the loop if it's a 1.
l = random.randint(1,6)
while True:
    print(l)
    if l == 1:

#5. Create a while loop that asks for a number input until the user inputs the number 0.
m = int(input("press 0 to exit"))
while m != 0:
    m = int(input("press 0 to exit"))
