#A common exercise in computer science is "FizzBuzz". The rules of
#the game are simple. Count from 1 to 100 but with every number that
#is divisible by 3 you say "Fizz" instead of the number,
#every number divisible by 5 you say "Buzz" instead,
#and if it's divisible by both you say "FizzBuzz".
k = 1
while k <= 100:
    if k % 3 == 0 and k % 5 == 0:
        print('fizzbuzz')
    elif k % 3 == 0:
        print('fizz')
    elif k % 5 == 0:
        print('buzz')
    else:
        print(k)
    k += 1
#Create a while loop that follows the rules of the game.
